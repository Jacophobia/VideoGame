# Overview

So my game is far from completion, the goal I had was to create a game with intuitive spear mechanics. Every solid object has a weight attribute, and I really wanted to have that mechanic emphasized in the background. I want to make a game where the player can stab things with a spear and, depending on their weight, can either move the item or move themselves. If the weight of the character was higher, then the player would be able to stab, move, and throw the things they grab. If the player weighed less than the stabbed item then they would be able to vault off of them. 

So far I have spear mechanics which allow the player to move a spear based on input taken from the right joystick of their controller. The spear also 'stabs' by moving in relation to the magnitude of the players right control stick. The player is able to move as well.

# Development Environment

I developed this game using the Unity Game Engine in the C# programming language.

# Useful Websites

* [Unity Scripting API](https://docs.unity3d.com/ScriptReference/MonoBehaviour.html)

# Future Work

1. I want to add more advanced player movement. I want to remove some of the momentum that is experienced when jumping and moving around so that the player has more control.
1. I want to add enemies and obstacles that the player can move or be moved by so that the motions have a platform where they can be used. 
1. I plan to add more control schemes for each scenario so that the player acts according to the situation they are in.
